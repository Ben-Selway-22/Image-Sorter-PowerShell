# A simple script to sort Jpeg and Raw images into seperate folders
As a Freelance photographer I shoot both Raws and Jpegs so that I can pick between them in post. I often spend a long time selecting all my Raws and moving them into a seperate folder to organise them and make it easier to manage. 

I have created this simple PowerShell script that allows me to very easily sort the images into there own folder so that they can be easily looked through. To run the script simply clone the repo and run there is no changes required as questions will be presented at the console level.
